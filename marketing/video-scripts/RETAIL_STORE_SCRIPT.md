SCENE BREAKDOWN:

[0:00-0:08] HOOK - THE PROBLEM
Visual: Store owner checking shelves, noticing empty spots, looking frustrated at computer screen
Text on screen: "Where did all the profit go?"
Voiceover: "You did great this month. Sales were up. Customers were happy. But somehow... the profit just isn't there. Where does it all go?"

[0:08-0:18] THE HIDDEN PROBLEM
Visual: Animation showing money floating away from cash register - split into "Overstock sitting on shelves", "Missed vendor overcharges", "Stockouts = lost sales"
Text on screen: "Death by a thousand cuts"
Voiceover: "That supplier who raised prices 15% and hoped you wouldn't notice. Products sitting in your backroom for 6 months, tying up cash. Running out of your best seller on a Saturday because nobody tracked it. Small leaks... big losses."

[0:18-0:30] INTRODUCE THE SOLUTION
Visual: Clean dashboard appearing, inventory items organizing themselves, alert notification sliding in
Text on screen: "Revenue Radar - See What You've Been Missing"
Voiceover: "What if you could see everything? Every price change. Every slow-moving item. Every product about to run out. Revenue Radar is like having a brilliant inventory manager who never sleeps and catches everything."

[0:30-0:45] SHOW THE FEATURES
Visual: Dashboard animations showing each feature

Feature 1 (5 sec): Invoice upload, AI extracting data
Voiceover: "Snap a photo of any invoice. Our AI pulls out every product, every price, every detail."

Feature 2 (5 sec): Side-by-side price comparison with alert
Voiceover: "Instantly compare prices across vendors. Get alerts when someone's overcharging."

Feature 3 (5 sec): Inventory dashboard with color-coded stock levels
Voiceover: "See exactly what's overstocked, what's running low, and what to reorder before you lose a single sale."

[0:45-0:55] THE RESULTS - REAL NUMBERS
Visual: Three counters animating: "Overcharges caught: $340", "Overstock reduced: $1,200", "Stockouts prevented: 47"
Text on screen: "Average retail store saves $1,500+/month"
Voiceover: "Our retail customers find an average of $1,500 in monthly savings. That's $18,000 a year hiding in plain sight."

[0:55-1:08] EMOTIONAL PAYOFF
Visual: Transition from dashboard to real life - store owner at daughter's dance recital, family dinner at nice restaurant, owner putting "Help Wanted - Higher Starting Pay!" sign in window
Text on screen: "What would you do with an extra $18,000?"
Voiceover: "That's not spreadsheet money. That's real life money. A college fund that actually grows. Date night without checking the budget. Paying your team what they deserve so they actually stick around. Revenue Radar finds the money. You make it matter."
