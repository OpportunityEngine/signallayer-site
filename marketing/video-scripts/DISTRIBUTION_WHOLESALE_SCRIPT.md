SCENE BREAKDOWN:

[0:00-0:08] HOOK - THE PROBLEM
Visual: Warehouse operations manager at desk with multiple monitors, spreadsheets everywhere, phone ringing
Text on screen: "Margins are tight. Are you catching everything?"
Voiceover: "In distribution, margins are razor thin. 2%, 3% if you're lucky. One missed price increase from a supplier. One billing error that slips through. That's your entire profit margin... gone."

[0:08-0:18] THE HIDDEN PROBLEM
Visual: Animation showing invoice stack, zooming into line items with red highlights - "Price variance: +8%", "Duplicate charge detected", "Contract price not applied"
Text on screen: "When you process 500+ invoices a month, things slip through"
Voiceover: "You're processing hundreds of invoices a month. Your team is doing their best. But when suppliers quietly raise prices, forget your negotiated rates, or double-bill... nobody has time to catch every single one. Until now."

[0:18-0:30] INTRODUCE THE SOLUTION
Visual: Clean enterprise dashboard appearing, invoices flowing in and being auto-analyzed, alerts generating
Text on screen: "Revenue Radar - Enterprise-Grade Invoice Intelligence"
Voiceover: "Revenue Radar uses AI to read every single invoice, compare every line item to your contracts and historical pricing, and flag anything that doesn't match. It's like having a team of auditors working 24/7... at a fraction of the cost."

[0:30-0:45] SHOW THE FEATURES
Visual: Dashboard animations showing each feature

Feature 1 (5 sec): Email integration showing invoices auto-importing
Voiceover: "Connect your email and invoices flow in automatically. PDF, Excel, images - we read them all."

Feature 2 (5 sec): Price trend chart with vendor comparison
Voiceover: "Track pricing across every vendor. See trends. Get alerts before small increases become big problems."

Feature 3 (5 sec): Contract compliance dashboard with green checkmarks and red flags
Voiceover: "Upload your contracts. We'll automatically verify every invoice matches your negotiated terms."

[0:45-0:55] THE RESULTS - REAL NUMBERS
Visual: Enterprise metrics animating: "Invoice errors caught: 127/month", "Contract compliance: 99.2%", "Annual savings recovered: $47,000"
Text on screen: "Average distributor recovers $35,000 - $75,000/year"
Voiceover: "Our distribution customers catch an average of 127 billing errors per month. That's $35,000 to $75,000 in annual savings that was walking out the door."

[0:55-1:08] EMOTIONAL PAYOFF
Visual: Transition from dashboard to real life - business owner leaving office at 5pm (not 9pm), coaching little league, family vacation at beach, handing employee profit-sharing check
Text on screen: "Protect your margins. Protect what matters."
Voiceover: "Look, this isn't just about spreadsheets. When your margins are protected, you're not stressed at 10pm running reports. You're at your kid's game. You're taking that vacation. You're sharing profits with the team who helped you earn them. Revenue Radar protects the numbers so you can protect what matters."

[1:08-1:15] CALL TO ACTION
Visual: Logo animation, enterprise demo button, "Schedule Demo" CTA
Text on screen: "See Your Savings in a 15-Minute Demo"
Voiceover: "Schedule a free demo. Bring your last month of invoices. We'll show you exactly what you've been missing. No commitment, just clarity."
