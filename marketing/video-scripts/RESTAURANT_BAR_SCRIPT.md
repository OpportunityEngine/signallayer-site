Text on screen: "Hidden price increases slip through"
Voiceover: "Your vodka supplier quietly raised prices 20% last month. Your produce guy charged you twice for the same delivery. That 'discount' you were promised? Never applied. These small things add up to thousands of dollars... just... gone."

[0:18-0:30] INTRODUCE THE SOLUTION
Visual: Phone notification pops up, transition to clean dashboard with gold accents
