SCENE BREAKDOWN:

[0:00-0:07] HOOK - THE RELATABLE MOMENT
Visual: Small business owner (could be salon, auto shop, florist, any small biz) at kitchen table at night, laptop open, invoices spread out, coffee cup
Text on screen: "Another late night with the invoices?"
Voiceover: "It's 10pm. The kids are asleep. And you're at the kitchen table... trying to figure out where all your money went. Sound familiar?"

[0:07-0:15] THE PROBLEM (SIMPLE)
Visual: Animation of money flying out of a wallet in different directions - "Supplier overcharges", "Missed discounts", "Things you forgot to catch"
Text on screen: "Small leaks sink ships"
Voiceover: "Here's the truth: you're probably losing hundreds of dollars every month to small stuff. Price increases nobody told you about. Discounts that never got applied. It adds up."

[0:15-0:25] THE SOLUTION (SIMPLE)
Visual: Phone buzzing with friendly notification, transitions to simple clean dashboard
Text on screen: "Revenue Radar watches your money so you don't have to"
Voiceover: "Revenue Radar is like a really smart friend who looks at all your invoices and says 'Hey, this doesn't look right' or 'You could save money if you ordered this way.' Simple as that."

[0:25-0:38] HOW IT WORKS (30-SECOND VERSION)
Visual: Three simple icons animating

Step 1 (4 sec): Camera icon pointing at invoice
Voiceover: "Take a picture of your invoices..."

Step 2 (4 sec): AI brain icon with sparkles
Voiceover: "Our AI reads every line..."

Step 3 (5 sec): Alert bell with dollar sign
Voiceover: "And tells you when something's wrong or when there's a better deal."

[0:38-0:48] THE PAYOFF
Visual: Counter showing "$847 found this month" then transitions to family moments montage - weekend breakfast together, school supplies shopping, family movie night
Text on screen: "What would an extra $800/month mean for you?"
Voiceover: "Most small business owners find $500 to $1,000 in savings they never knew existed. That's not business money. That's 'finally fix the car' money. 'Take the kids to Disney' money. 'Actually relax on Sunday' money."

[0:48-0:60] CALL TO ACTION + EMOTIONAL CLOSE
Visual: Logo, then warm image of business owner closing laptop at reasonable hour, smiling, going to join family
Text on screen: "Free for 30 days. See your savings in 5 minutes."
Voiceover: "Try Revenue Radar free. No credit card. No commitment. Just upload one invoice and see what you've been missing. You work hard enough. Let us help you keep more of what you earn."

END CARD:
